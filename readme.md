# Some notes on this project

Personal technical blog. To document technical explorations on various topics including crypto, AI programming, data processing, traditional finance - Equities etc. Programming languages 

Aim to cover my interests in diverse fields from programming language nuances, font choice, development tools, impact of crypto and blockchain on the real world

And document learning journeys - for example building something almost entirely using ai coding tools.

Theme wise - should express the technical nature of the content. I'm a big fan of markdown - so having some of the syntax 'leak' through isn't a bad thing. eg the # prefix for headings.
