# Design Review of Cielago Blog

After reviewing your Zola-based technical blog, I have several observations and recommendations. The current implementation shows many strengths while also having opportunities for refinement.

## Current Strengths

- **Typography**: The Monaspace Neon font is an excellent choice for a technical blog. It's highly readable with good character differentiation and ligature support.
- **Minimalist Approach**: The clean, uncluttered layout puts focus on content which is ideal for technical writing.
- **Markdown Visual Elements**: The "#" prefixes for headers create a familiar coding/markdown feel that resonates with the technical audience.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Offering both modes is considerate to user preferences.
- **Table of Contents**: Good structural addition that enhances navigation for longer articles.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Color Refinement

- **Light Mode**: The current teal accent color (rgb(13, 197, 160)) is vibrant but could benefit from a more sophisticated palette. Consider adding complementary secondary colors (perhaps a muted blue or purple) for visual hierarchy.
- **Dark Mode**: The neon green (#50fa7b) is striking but somewhat harsh. Consider a slightly less saturated version that maintains the "code" aesthetic while reducing visual strain.
- **Dark Mode Code Highlighting**: The bright blue background for code in dark mode creates excessive contrast. A darker blue with subtle syntax highlighting would be more readable.

### 2. Spacing and Layout

- **Content Width**: Consider increasing the maximum content width slightly (currently 800px) to better accommodate code blocks without excessive wrapping.
- **Vertical Rhythm**: Add more consistent spacing between elements (paragraphs, code blocks, headings) for improved readability.
- **Header Spacing**: Increase space before headers (particularly h2 and h3) to better delineate content sections.

### 3. Visual Elements

- **Code Block Styling**: Enhance code block styling with subtle border radius (2-3px) and improved syntax highlighting for better readability.
- **Link Styling**: The current underline approach works, but consider using a subtle background color change on hover instead of or in addition to the underline for better visual feedback.
- **Header Differentiation**: While keeping the "#" prefix, consider subtle size differences between heading levels for better visual hierarchy.

### 4. Technical Fixes

- **CORS Issues**: Fix the CORS issues with font loading by ensuring fonts are properly served from relative paths instead of absolute URLs to blog.cielago.xyz.
- **Font Fallbacks**: Add appropriate system font fallbacks to prevent layout shifts if custom fonts fail to load.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure responsive behavior is smooth across all device sizes.

### 5. Accessibility Improvements

- **Color Contrast**: Ensure all text meets WCAG AA standards for contrast (particularly for inline code and links).
- **Focus States**: Add visible focus states for keyboard navigation without disrupting the minimal aesthetic.

These recommendations respect your non-negotiable elements while enhancing the overall user experience. The goal is to maintain the technical, programmer-oriented feel while refining the visual design for improved readability and aesthetic appeal.
