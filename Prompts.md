> I've added some content to the draft. Can you expand the content as laid out in the following :
1. Can you please flesh out the tools section with more detail on each one mentioned ? include a brief summary of each one, as well as the pros / cons vs other options based on the skeleton content
2. make the first reference to each tool a hyperlink to it's web page
3. Add links to each tool in the references section. Along with any other pertinent references.

Reference the online documentation and other references for each tool as inputs

Don't make it too verbose.
