> I've added some content to the draft. Can you expand the content as laid out in the following :
1. Can you please flesh out the tools section with more detail on each one mentioned ? include a brief summary of each one, as well as the pros / cons vs other options based on the skeleton content
2. make the first reference to each tool a hyperlink to it's web page
3. Add links to each tool in the references section. Along with any other pertinent references.

Reference the online documentation and other references for each tool as inputs

Don't make it too verbose.

> As an accomplished web developer with excellent design sense please review the site theme, colors, and overall visual design and provide an opinion and recommendations for improvements if relevant. Bearing in mind this is a technical blog, by a programmer for programmers. So some decisions - like fixed width font, and 'Markdown' visual elements like the # in front of headings are non-negotiable

## Search bar

24 March 

As an accomplished web developer with excellent design sense implement a search widget for this blog.

- use elasticlunr for index building - as documented at https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/search/
- add an unobtrusive search icon to the left of the light / dark mode selector
- clicking on the icon should make a minimalist search widget available to the right of the icon. 
- Then typing into the search bar works as is normal for a zola blog.
- for extra points, think
- present a proposal and ideally a screenshot / mockup before applying any code changes.

- this post might be a useful reference https://adrianstobbe.com/posts/zola-searchbar/

Can you move the search icon all the way to the left side, beside the Home link, and with the small vertical separator. 

Then have the popup render in the middle of the screen - similar to the screenshot below.

My favorite way to include documentation in prompts is using aider. It has a nice feature that crawls links using playwright.
