## About me

Experienced software engineer based in Tokyo Japan. 

## Blogs I like

Caveat that - as with anything on the web these may well get stale.

- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) - interesting programming stuff inc terminal observations
- [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) blogging about ai, llms and [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/) a very cool python library for interacting with LLMs.
