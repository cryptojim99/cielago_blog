I've always been a bit of a font nerd. Especially once more fixed width coding fonts came out like  [Consolas](https://learn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/typography/font-list/consolas), but even more now that we have things like Ligatures, nerd fonts, powerline fonts etc. 

The latest I've been using, is a series of fonts from Github called monspace, one of which (neon) I've using for this site.

## Ligatures

<!-- --> <-- ->> <<- -> <- <--> => <=> <==> ==> <== >>= =<< -- := =:= == === !== != <= >= // /** /* */ && .& || !! :: >> << ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ __ ___ .. ...  ~- -~ &= <|> {| |} #[ #( ;;; @_

Included with the new 1.200 [release](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases/tag/v1.200). Some examples :

## Using on web pages

This is common for serving *any* web font, but was something new for me - so adding here for reference.
